# book-store
Build with The MERN stack comprising MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js, which together facilitate the development of full-stack JavaScript applications.We demonstrates how to integrate these technologies to build a functional bookstore web.

Key features include:
Inventory Management: Implementing functionalities to add, update, and delete books from the inventory, ensuring efficient management of the bookstore's catalog.
Authentication System: Setting up user authentication to secure the application, allowing only authorized users to perform certain actions within the app.

 Backend Development
 Database Setup:
 MongoDB is used to create a database for the bookstore.
 Collections like users and books are structured to store user and book information.
 API Development:
 Express.js is used to build RESTful APIs.
 Endpoints are created for:
 User registration and login (including password hashing for security).
 CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing book inventory.
 the setup is tested on VScode with local servers
